# AJCE Website - Course Details Page

## What's New? 🎉

I've created a **dedicated courses page** (`courses.html`) with comprehensive details for all 6 engineering programs!

### Files Created/Updated:

1. **courses.html** - New detailed courses page with:
   - Individual course cards for each program
   - Key specializations
   - Course highlights 
   - Career opportunities
   - Beautiful gradient designs matching each course theme
   - Smooth scroll animations

2. **index.html** - Updated navigation links:
   - "Courses" nav link now goes to `courses.html`
   - All "Explore" buttons on course cards link to specific course sections on the new page
   - Footer courses link updated

### How It Works:

- **Click "Courses" in navigation** → Opens courses.html page
- **Click "Explore" on any course card** → Opens courses.html and scrolls to that specific course
- **Click "Back to Home"** → Returns to index.html

### Features of the New Courses Page:

✅ **6 Detailed Course Cards:**
   - Computer Science & Engineering
   - Electrical & Electronics Engineering
   - Civil Engineering
   - Mechanical Engineering
   - Chemical Engineering
   - Food Technology

✅ **For Each Course:**
   - Beautiful gradient header with unique color theme
   - Detailed description
   - Key specializations list
   - Course highlights (labs, projects, placements)
   - Career opportunities grid
   - Smooth animations on scroll

✅ **Design Features:**

## To Deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. Copy the files to your GitHub repository:
